# MAGD-Assignments

**Cordero 10** - For this project I had to find and use a p5js library. The library I chose was p5play, and through this library I was able to create a sprite which was effected by gravity that has simple motion controles.

**Cordero8** - For this project I had to use a webserver to add images to my p5js code. I used an image of a generic game background and a pixel art charecter that you can move with the mouse.

**Cordero6** - For this project I used an array to make a firefly that can be moved with the mouse.
